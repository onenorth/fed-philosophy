# Overview
This living document is intended to present, organize and illustrate our practices in front-end development (FED).

## What is a FED?
Put simply, front-end Developers work on client facing assets.  Here, FEDs play a role in early stages of a project, working closely with creative and strategy to build prototypes and templates of sites.  FEDs also help in production and support stages of projects. 

- A FED is an expert in the fields a full stack developer is only familiar with
- A FED should identify potential issues with a design that might have poor usability
- A FED should find a time to share knowledge amongst other teams within the company.

# FED Guiding Principles
## Maintainability
- Follow existing standards
  - If there’s an opportunity to improve that is a low effort/cost: Improve it
  - Develope under the assumption you are not the one maintaining the code base

### Consistent Nomenclature
- CSS / HTML
  - https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml
  - BEM, SMACSS, or similar naming conventions

```css

	.bio {
		
	}
	
	.bio-image {
		width:200px;
		height:200px;
	}
	
	.bio-image-small {
		width:100px;
		height:100px;
		
	}
	
```



- Javascript
  - [Google JS Styleguide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml)
  - [Airbnb JS Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

### Modulization of CSS/JS/HTML
See /examples folder 

#### Component Principles to Follow
- Self contained
- One Thing Very Well
- Extensible
- Defined at any degree
  - e.g.: Responsive Wrapper, Header, navigation, primary button
- Reuse other components as much as possible
- Use Bower to Handle Components when possible

### GIT Early, GIT Often
We cannot stress this enough. GIT After Every:

- Module
- Component
- Feature
- 10 lines of code (as an extreme example)

## Documentation
Documentation is the most important step and is required for every build. It doesn't take more than 15 minutes and it's great to lay out your toolkit so there are no surprises later on in the build. Get this out of the way, first. Make changes as you go along.

TLDR; Categories Required:

- Browser Support
- Technologies Used
- Compatibility Notes
- Environment Setup Instructions 
- Dependencies Used
- Additional Notes/Information

## Performance
- Stress / Smoke Testing
- Proficiency in ALL Dev tools for each browser
	- Chrome Dev Tools
	- Firefox Dev Tools / Firebug
	- IE F12 Tools
- Proficiency in using profiling tools and understanding data
	- Understand what every tab inside Chrome Dev Tools does and why
	
## Code Reviews
- Developers should review their own code and peer review others. MAX 15 minutes for yourself and MAX 15 minutes for others. 
- This should be done on a daily basis (Don't GIT a whole day's worth of work!)

# Technologies 
List out the utilities / frameworks you're going to be using for the project. If there are any issues, or technologies in question, list these under compatibility notes.

- SCSS 3.3+ (Ruby)
- Angular JS 1.3+ (IE9+)
- jQuery 1.10.0 (_see compatibility notes_)
- Font Awesome (4.2.1) (IE9+)

## Recommendations
- Use popular technologies. Going rogue will only cause problems for new devs on a project and could cause potential problems when doing research
  - SCSS
  - Yeoman
  - Coffeescript
  - Angular JS

### Common Editors / IDE's You'll see 
- Netbeans
- Sublime Text
- Webstorm
- VIM

### jQuery vs Native Javascript 
Is it really worth using jQuery for some of the projects you're asked to work on? If it's something small, IE9+ many of the selectors you're using to are about **60x** faster than their jQuery equivalent.

```javascript

$('.element').addClass('newClass'); 

vs. 

document.querySelector('.element').className = 'newClass'; IE8+
document.getElementsByClassName('element')[0].className = 'newClass'; IE9+

document.querySelectorAll();
document.getElementById();

```

```javascript

$('.element').append('<p>Paragraph</p>');

vs.

document.getElementsByClassName('element')[0].innerHTML += '<p>Paragraph</p>';

```

```javascript

var $element = $('.element');

$element.on('click', function(e) {
	console.log('clicked');
	e.preventDefault();
});

vs. 

var _element = document.getElementsByClassName('element')[0];

_element.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
	console.log('clicked');
	e.preventDefault();
});

```

```javascript

$.ajax ({
	url: 'website.com',
	type: 'POST',
	data: 'a=10&b=4',
	success: function (d) {
		console.log(d);
	}
});

vs.

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhr.open("POST", "website.com", true);

xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
	if (xhr.readyState != 4 || xhr.status != 200) return;
	console.log(xhr.responseText);
};

xhr.send("a=10&b=4");

```

## Browser Support
Provide **all** documentation within the project.

**Most projects will be IE9+**

- Check to make sure - don't shoot yourself in the foot by going with an IE9+ utility only to realize you need IE8 support

**List out complete browser support inside the README.md**

- If you're not sure about something, ask your account manager to **send you an email**.
- There is a difference between Chrome on an IPhone and Android. There are differences between Android Phones, etc.

### Currently Supported Browsers:
- IE 9+ 
- Chrome 20+
- Firefox 7+
- iOS 6+ Mobile Safari
- Android 4.x+ Browser
- Android Chrome Browser (Edge)
- Safari 6+ (OSX)

### Compatibility Notes 

If there is something that doesn't fall under an assumption, list it here

# Environment Setup
If you find yourself using a specific toolset for your development environment, make sure to list it here. If you're using a package.json file and/or bower.json, run ```npm shrinkwrap``` to lock in the version of whatever project you're using.

List your dev dependecies that you've got inside your package.json / bower.json. Run ```npm shrinkwrap``` before you're done to lock in the correct version. There will be times where a project will break if dependencies do not have a correct version number. Bower does not currently have this implemented but will soon [Bower Issue #1362](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/1362)

### Common Development Dependencies
- Node
- Grunt (task runner)
- Gulp ( new task runner)
- SCSS ( css pre-compiler)
- Bower (package dependency manager)
- Jasmin
- Karma

# Project Setup & Scaffold
- Create a GIT repo on Bitbucket.
- Project Directory Tree should mimic what the industry does for JS projects
- Use a *real* IDE. Although we shouldn’t discriminate by text editor, IDEs that save time and money are what business owners are looking for. The greater industry of development also appreciates everyone knowing the top tier IDEs.

### Scaffolding Out a Project (TBD)
#### Angular Projects:

- [Yeoman - AngularJS](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
	- [Google AngularJS Best Practices & Recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub)

#### Lightweight Projects:
- [Yeoman - Gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp)
	- [Recipes will make your life easier](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp/blob/master/docs/recipes/README.md)
	
Includes:

- Gulp
- Sass
- Bootstrap (chances are you won't need this)
- Modernizr

Any additional components are installed as easily as running bower search and install:

-  ```bower search jQuery``` 
-  ```bower install jQuery --save```

Learn more about installing and using Yeoman [here](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html).

# Time Estimation
## Reconnaissance
- Gathering Information about a Project
- The more details about the Project the better, assumptions create risk

## Company evaluation
- Business Evaluation
	- Business
		- how many hours have been predefined? Does that align with what you think that might take?
		- What’s the purpose / what are you trying to solve?
	- Technical
		- How long will it take to create using a certain library/utility/framework?
	- Creative
		- Design direction and UX recommendations
	- Complexity Level from all 
	- Risks and Opportunities
- FED Evaluation
	- Browser Compatibility
		- **Ask for browser support. OSX vs Windows. There’s a difference between Firefox on Mobile and in the browser. Get a defined list.**
		- Responsive Principles
		- Frameworks to leverage
			- Grid frameworks like Susy vs whipping up your own
	- Research & Development

## Scoping Requirements and hourly Estimation
- Estimation Overview
	- Calculate hours on all requirements
	- Calculate hours and add padding on certain risks
	- Add padding for certain levels of complexity
		- browser support
		- creating new ideas
- Breakdown scoped requirements for estimation
	- Componetize Everything
	- Headers
	- Footers
	- Side Bar
	- Navigation
- Secondary Requirements
	- Padding for potential browser compatibility issues
	- Padding for potential responsive defects
	- PITA Padding
- Solutions for Potential Risks
	- Coming up with Fallbacks:
		- Plan A (CSS3)
		- Plan B (JQuery)
		- Plan C (Escalating to Higher Power)

# Topics Under Consideration
## Continuous Integration
- One Canonical Branch **master**
- No developer will ever commit directly into master
- Developer will branch off master on the feature they're working on. **feature branches**
- When feature is complete, a request to merge into master ** pull request**
- An individual who did not writ the code will 
- **At no point should a developer merge their own code into master**
- Compiled output should be ignored in .gitignore

## Device Detection
- DON'T DO IT!

## Feature Detection
## Graceful Degradation
